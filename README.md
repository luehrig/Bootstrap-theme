### What?

Responsive Fork CMS theme base on Bootstrap from Twitter.

### Known issues

##### Searchbox

Does not follow the Bootstrap styling. This require changes in the search action file.

##### Submenu's

Due to a restriction in Fork CMS you can not assign a different template to the sub navigation. This Fork CMS version has been changed to allow that.

If you don't want the modified Fork CMS version this can be accomplished via Javascript. You can comment out line 3 in twitter.js
